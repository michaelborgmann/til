# TIL: Today I Learned

A TIL (Today I Learned) is a brief note capturing something interesting, useful, or technical that you've discovered, typically under 200 words. These insights are too small for a full blog post but too valuable to forget. This repository serves as my personal knowledge base, where I organize and share the small discoveries and tips I pick up along the way. Inspired by other TIL repositories, I‚Äôve transitioned from keeping my notes scattered or private to building this collection, which I plan to grow over time, one TIL at a time.
